       A tool to compare audio files in time and frequency

            https://github.com/gillesdegottex/dfasma
</code></pre>

<p>DFasma is an open-source software used to compare audio files in time and
frequency. The comparison is first visual, using wavforms and spectra.
It is also possible to listen to time-frequency segments in order to allow
perceptual comparison.</p>

<p>This software is coded in C/C++ using the Qt library (<a href="http://qt-project.org">http://qt-project.org</a>).
It is stored as a GitHub project (<a href="https://github.com/gillesdegottex/dfasma">https://github.com/gillesdegottex/dfasma</a>).</p>

<p>Goals
    * The interface and the audio files have to be loaded as quick as possible.
    * Any kind of lossless audio files should be easily loaded (it can
      currently use libsndfile or libsox which support ~25 different formats).
    * All features should run on Linux, OS X and Migrosoft operating systems.
    * Manage mono audio files (tracks of multi-channel files (e.g. stereo) can
      be loaded separately. A more advanced management of multi-channel files
      could be addressed in the future)
    * Even though there are basic functionnalities to align the signals in 
      time and amplitude, this software does not aim to be an audio editor.</p>
