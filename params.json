The comparison is first visual, using wavforms and spectra.\r\nIt is also possible to listen to time-frequency segments in order to allow\r\nperceptual comparison.\r\n\r\nThis software is coded in C/C++ using the Qt library (http://qt-project.org).\r\nIt is stored as a GitHub project (https://github.com/gillesdegottex/dfasma).\r\n\r\n\r\nGoals\r\n    * The interface and the audio files have to be loaded as quick as possible.\r\n    * Any kind of lossless audio files should be easily loaded (it can\r\n      currently use libsndfile or libsox which support ~25 different formats).\r\n    * All features should run on Linux, OS X and Migrosoft operating systems.\r\n    * Manage mono audio files (tracks of multi-channel files (e.g. stereo) can\r\n      be loaded separately. A more advanced management of multi-channel files\r\n      could be addressed in the future)\r\n    * Even though there are basic functionnalities to align the signals in \r\n      time and amplitude, this software does not aim to be an audio editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Gilles Degottex <gilles.degottex@gmail.com>\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n    This software is under the GPL (v3) License.
